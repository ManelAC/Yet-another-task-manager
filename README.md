## How to use
The first thing you will need to use this program is a copy of the files in the `src` and the `assets` folders.

Once you have them, you will need to drop those files in your web server. After that, you will need to make sure you have the right versions of PHP and SQL in place to use the files. You will find a SQL file in the `database_structure` folder that you can use it to import to your database so you don't need to recreate the database manually.

This project has been developed using a WAMP compilation, with SQL in it version `10.4.24-MariaDB` and PHP in its version `8.1.6`, but you may be able to use it in different versions.
